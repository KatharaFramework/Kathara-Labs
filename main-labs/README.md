# Main Labs
This section contains the network scenarios used in the course of "Internet and Data Centers" at
Roma Tre university. 

The network scenarios cover several topics. For each topic there are different scenarios and for each of them you can find 
the related explanation slides.

* [Basic Topics](basic-topics): A set of network scenarios on basic networking topics.
* [Application Level](application-level): A set of network scenarios on the application level.
* [Intradomain Routing](intradomain-routing): A set of network scenarios on intradomain routing using RIP and OSPF protocols.
* [Interdomain Routing](interdomain-routing): A set of network scenarios on interdomain routing using BGP.
* [Data Center Routing](data-center-routing): A set of network scenarios on data center routing.
* [Labs Integrating Several Technologies](labs-integrating-several-technologies): A set of network scenarios integrating several technologies.
* [P4](p4) (Thanks to ETH Zurich :smile:): A set of network scenarios on programmable switches using P4. 
* [sdn](sdn-openflow): A set of network scenarios on SDN and Openflow.
