# Kathara Labs
This repository contains the official network scenarios of [Kathará](https://github.com/KatharaFramework/Kathara).

## Tutorials
The [tutorials](tutorials) directory contains several tutorials about basic and advanced usage of Kathará:
* [Kathará Introduction](tutorials/introduction): Introduction slides of the Kathará tool.
* [Capture Packets](tutorials/capture-packets): A tutorial explaining how to capture packets using the [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/) GUI in Kathará.
* [Traffic Control](tutorials/traffic-control): Several tutorials explaining how to use the `tc` tool to control, manipulate and
shape traffic inside Kathará.
* [Kathará External](tutorials/kathara-external): Tutorials explaining how to configure Kathará External to attach a Kathará
device to the host physical interfaces (**Linux only**).  
* [Python API](tutorials/python-api): Several tutorials about the usage of the Kathará Python APIs. 

## Main Labs
The [main-labs](main-labs) directory contains the network scenarios used in the course of "Internet and Data Centers" at
Roma Tre university. 

The network scenarios cover several topics. For each topic there are different scenarios and for each of them you can find 
the related explanatory slides.
* [Basic Topics](main-labs/basic-topics)
* [Application Level](main-labs/application-level)
* [Intradomain Routing](main-labs/intradomain-routing)
* [Interdomain Routing](main-labs/interdomain-routing)
* [Data Center Routing](main-labs/data-center-routing)
* [Labs Integrating Several Technologies](main-labs/labs-integrating-several-technologies)
* [P4](main-labs/p4) (Thanks to ETH Zurich :smile:)
* [SDN-Openflow](main-labs/sdn-openflow)
* [Cybersecurity](cybersecurity)

## Community Labs
The [community-labs](community-labs) directory contains a collection of network scenarios from the Kathará community.

## Exercises 
The [exercises](exercises) directory contains a set of exercises that leverage the 
[kathara-lab-checker](https://github.com/KatharaFramework/kathara-lab-checker) tool to offer autocorrection for students.

Each exercise includes specific requirements that students need to meet. Using the kathara-lab-checker, 
students can run tests to ensure that their configuration meets the criteria, receiving feedback if any adjustments are needed.

## Exam Labs
The [exam-labs](exam-labs) directory contains the network scenarios used for the practical exams of the course 
"Internet and Data Centers" at Roma Tre University.

For each scenario you can find a `.pdf` file containing the exam's text and the relative solution. 

You can use it for training and practice!

## Netkit Labs

If you need additional network scenarios, you can visit the old [Netkit Lab Page](https://www.netkit.org/exams.html). 

**Beware those network scenarios are not tested on Kathará, so they may not work properly!**
