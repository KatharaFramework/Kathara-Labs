## Exercises 
The [exercises](exercises) directory contains a set of exercises that leverage the 
[kathara-lab-checker](https://github.com/KatharaFramework/kathara-lab-checker) tool to offer autocorrection for students.

Each exercise includes specific requirements that students need to meet. Using the kathara-lab-checker, 
students can run tests to ensure that their configuration meets the criteria, receiving feedback if any adjustments are needed.

## Exam Labs
The [exam-labs](exam-labs) directory contains the network scenarios used for the practical exams of the course 
"Internet and Data Centers" at Roma Tre University.

For each scenario you can find a `.pdf` file containing the exam's text and the relative solution. 

You can use it for training and practice!
